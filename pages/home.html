            <p>I work for Behance/Adobe as a Sr. Software Engineer. Previously I worked for some shitty FinTech company for about 6 months. That was a learning experience, but mostly sucked. Before that, I had the great pleasure of working for The New York Times. While there, I wore a number of hats, including blah blah blah. Other past employers include Credit Suisse, IAC/InterActive Corp, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Sears.</p>
